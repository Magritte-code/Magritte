_*Preparing for first release...*_

This is the repository of the Magritte main library. Magritte is a modern open-
source software library for radiation transport simulation, with an emphasis on
3D radiative transfer simulations in astrophysics and cosmology. Its main solver
uses a deterministic ray-tracer with a formal solver that currently focusses on
line radiative transfer. See the first Magritte paper
([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08445.pdf),
[MNRAS](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz3557)) for more details.

Magritte can either be used as a C++ library or as a Python package.


## Installation
First, download the dependencies and configure Magritte using
```bash
bash dependencies/get_dependencies.sh
```
Then, create an anaconda environment from the environment file with
```bash
conda env create -f dependencies/conda_env.yml
```
Afterwards, activate the environment you just created with
```bash
conda activate magritte
```
Now Magritte can be build using
```bash
bash build.sh
```
This builds the library in the `/bin` folder. Note that if you try to build
Magritte from outside the `magritte_env` conda environment compilation might
fail or the generated library might not work in python due to version mismatches.
Therefore as a general rule: **always build and use Magritte from within the
magritte_env conda environment**. To use Magritte's python interface, you should
include the package folder in your python path e.g. by including
```python
from sys import path
path.append("path/to/Magritte")
```
Please have a look at the `build.sh` script for further configuration options.
