Welcome to the Magritte repository! Magritte is a open-source software library for
simulating radiation transport, developed at
[University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL, UK) and
[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) (Belgium).

Magritte is currently mainly used for post-processing hydrodynamical simulations of
astrophysical models by creating synthetic observations, but the techniques could
in principle also be applied more general (e.g. plasma and nuclear physics).  

It can either be used as a Python package or as a C++ library.
Magritte uses a deterministic ray-tracer with a formal solver that currently focusses on
line radiative transfer (see
[De Ceuster et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1812D/abstract)
for more details). The plot below shows synthetic observations made with
Magritte at three different inclinations for a hydro simulation of the stellar wind around
an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star as it is perturbed by a companion.

The hydro model was created by Jan Bolte using [MPI-AMRVAC](http://amrvac.org/). See the
[examples](https://magritte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_examples/index.html) in the
documentation to learn how these synthetic observations were created with Magritte.
