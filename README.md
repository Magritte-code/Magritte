_*Preparing for first release...*_

This is the repository for Magritte: a modern open- source software library for
radiation transport simulation. Currently, the emphasis is on 3D radiative
transfer modelling for astrophysics and cosmology, but the techniques could also
be applied more general. Magritte uses a deterministic ray-tracer with a
formal solver that currently focusses on line radiative transfer. See this paper
([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08445.pdf),
[MNRAS](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz3557)) for more details.

Magritte can either be used as a C++ library or as a Python package.
