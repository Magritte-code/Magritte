Analytic benchmarks
###################

Magritte was tested against a set of analytic benchmarks, i.e. models for which an semi-analytic solution is known.
These models and the performance of Magritte on them are described in `De Ceuster et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1812D>`_.
The scripts to setup and run these benchmarks are provided with Magritte and can be found `here <https://github.com/Magritte-code/Magritte/tree/stable/tests/benchmarks/analytic>`_.
